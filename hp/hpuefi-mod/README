=======================

1. Move the base driver tar file to the directory of your choice.  For
   example, use /home/username/hpuefi-mod or /usr/local/src/hpuefi-mod.

2. Untar/unzip archive:

     # tar zxf hpuefi-mod-x.x.x.tar.gz

3. Change to the driver src directory:

     # cd hpuefi-mod-x.x.x/

4. Compile the driver module:

     # make

   The loadable kernel module will be compiled as hpuefi.ko.

5. Make sure that any older hpuefi drivers are removed from the kernel
   prior to loading the new module:

     # sudo rmmod hpuefi

6. Load the new module using the insmod command:

     # sudo insmod hpuefi.ko
